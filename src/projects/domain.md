Domain.com and its family of 4 websites is one of the top domain registrars in the world.

While already the Lead Developer for the HostGator FOS Team, I joined HostGator's sister brand, Domain.com to lead their FOS Team and advance up an Engineering Management career track.

Among the team's core responsibilities was extensive updating and A/B testing of various product offerings within the registration flow.
