Product site for HostGator's web hosting and domain registration services.

My direct contributions are found in various places as we all worked on components in parallel, but I often specialized in highly visual and/or complex layout components, such as homepage/product heroes, navigation, and comparison tables. Elements where high information density had to be provided to the user in a clear and understandable manner across all screen sizes and devices.

On the managerial side, as Lead Developer I was the liaison between the development team of six, and the Product Owner, Stakeholders, and various other teams and departments. In particular I am very effective in communicating complex technical concepts to non-technical colleagues. Internally I led all of our daily and bi-weekly ceremonies, acting as defacto scrum master when that position was vacated. And while I was the one primarily responsible for project planning the long multi-phase effort, I made sure everyone in the team was involved in every step of the process. Each sprint ended with a Retroactive to be given a space to identify ways of improving our process and acknowledge individual and team successes.

All throughout I also conducted regular one-on-one meetings with each team member, to discuss their individual strengths and challenges, their career goals, and any other thoughts. Any needs or hurdles they had I would turn into action items for me to follow up on. We would often have group discussions on code, best practices, and what standards we place for ourselves. Everyone was encouraged to ask questions without embarrassment, which often became learning opportunities for everyone. I also organized coding exercises for the group at the end of each sprint, so we could explore different techniques that might not come up in our daily work but were of interest.
