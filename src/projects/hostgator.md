Product site for HostGator's various web hosting and domain registration services. Created and updated product sites in a fast paced, CI/CD marketing environment.

As Lead Developer my role was a mix of direct development and engineering management. My technical specialty was in tackling complex and/or scalable UI components. I also mentored the team's junior developers in best practices, overcoming technical challenges, and skill training.

On the managerial side, I was the liaison between the development team of six, and the Product Owner, Stakeholders, and various other teams and departments. Internally I acted as team scrummaster and conducted our development ceremonies. Regularly communicated with each team member for onboarding and career pathing.

Our cornerstone achievement was a complete rewrite of the website, moving from an aging Perl/Mason stack to a modern React/Next.js architecture with Contentful CMS integration. I took point on breaking down the large project into a manageable roadmap, developing the CMS content structure, and taking on more challenging development tasks.
