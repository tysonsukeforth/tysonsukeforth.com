To-Jo Mushrooms needed a fresh new look for their company website and blog that was also easy for them to maintain.

To achieve this I wrote a fully customized WordPress theme that conveys the companies vibrant personality. It includes such UI features as hero content blocks with video backgrounds that play on hover, animated menus, and a seemless responsive layout.

Behind the scenes their WordPress dashboard was highly customized as well. Taking advantage of Advanced Custom Fields and other techniques, the content creation process was streamlined to be as foolproof as possible. Image and media processing is handled by the template to be plug and play.

Nine years later, the site is still going strong.
